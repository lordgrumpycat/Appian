# Appian
Code snippets and interface expressions written in Appian - Primarily UX Focused. 


Appian code is written in SAIL, a proprietary expression language deriving functions from various other, more standard, languages - such as Python, Java and C. Whilst touted as a 'low-code' platform, Appian development is anything but. Relying on webAPI endpoints and connected systems to complete complex reporting and automation of business processing. The system is designed in such a way that anyone can put together an idea for a process, but it still requires significant developer resource to bring ideas to the business.
